Basic Scala project built over a few days with no previous knowledge of Scala. It's only here as a demonstration of some exposure to Scala and its ecosystem.

The project is a simple twitteresqe app built using the Play framework with Slick for functional-relational mapping, Silhouette for authentication and sbt as the build tool.
